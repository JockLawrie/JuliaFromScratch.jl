# My First Project

Get started with Julia without any previous experience.

Read the docs [here](docs/src/index.md)

The examples focus on manipulating tabular data that includes dates.



## Start a project for learning and experimentation

In Julia, a project is a package, which can be thought of as a library of functions.
Some packages are built in, such as the _Dates_ package that provides functions such as computing the number of days between 2 dates.
The set of built-in packages is called the _standard library_, or [stdlib](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/) for short.

There are thousands of packages available outside the standard library, created by users around the world.
You can search these via Google or [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/lp/).

To start your own project, first create a folder where you'll keep your code. For example, `C:\\Users\username\code`.
Open the Julia REPL (the command line interface...Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) and enter the following:

```julia
cd("C:\\Users\\username\\code")  # Navigate to where you keep your code
using Pkg                        # Make Julia’s package management functions available
Pkg.generate(“MyTestPackage”)    # Generate a new package
```

In your file explorer, look at the files now present at `C:\\Users\username\code\MyTestPackage`.
You will see some newly created files with the following structure, which is the minimum requirement for Julia a package:

```bash
Project.toml
src\MyTestPackage.jl
```

Open the `Project.toml` in any editor and note that this file contains information about the package.
You needn't edit this file - more  information will be automatically added as you develop the package.
Close `Project.toml`.

Open `src\MyTestPackage.jl`. It contains a module called `MyTestPackage`, which contains a simple print statement.
A _module_ contains some combination of functions and more modules.
It's Julia's way of constructing and organising libraries of functions.
Julia _packages_ are modules that can be used by writing `using modulename`.

Replace the contents of `src\MyTestPackage.jl` with the following code.
Note that `src\MyFirstProject` contains the same code for reference.

```julia
module MyTestPackage

export nextday  # Make nextday available outside this package

using Dates     # Import the Dates package

"Returns: The date following the input date"
function nextday(dt::Date)
    dt + Day(1)
end

end
```

Our package now contains a function `nextday` which takes a `Date` as input and returns the date 1 day after the input date.
Note that it uses the `Dates` package from the standard library (`using Dates`) and makes the `nextday` function available for use by other code (`export nextday`).

Now let's use the package. In Julia type the following:


```julia
cd("MyTestPackage")  # Navigate to the package

#=
  Search for information about the nextday function.
  None is found because Julia can't see the function.
=#
?nextday

# Make the nextday function available
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
using MyTestPackage
```

Note the warning. It arises because the package code contains `using Dates`, but the `Dates` package hasn't yet been made available to our package.
To do this we have to add `Dates` to our package's list of dependencies by typing `Pkg.add("Dates")`.

The first time you do this will take a minute or 2 because Julia fetches the list of packages that are publicly available
(known as the `General` package registry). Adding further packages won't take so long.

Note that `Project.toml` now lists `Dates` as a dependency of our package.
You can see this at the REPL by typing `Pkg.status()`.

Also note the newly created `MyTestPackage\Manifest.toml` file, which is automatically generated and updated, you needn’t ever edit this file.
It lists the dependencies, and dependencies of dependencies. That is, it lists every package needed to use `MyTestPackage`.
It also lists the version numbers of each dependency.
This is helpful when copying an existing package to a new directory or a new machine – just
type `Pkg.instantiate()` and Julia will use `Manifest.toml` to fetch all dependencies with the correct versions.

Now we can use the package. Try this:

```julia
using MyTestPackage  # Make the nextday function available
?nextday             # The docstring is displayed (which we wrote above the function defintion).
?today               # No help available because the function isn't yet available to our REPL
using Dates          # Make date-related functions available, including today().
?today               # Now the REPL can see the today function

# Use the functions
nextday(today())
nextday(Date(2021, 3, 15))
nextday(Date("2021-03-15"))
```

## Scripts

Once the REPL is closed the code above is lost.
A good way to save it for reuse is to store it in a file.
Since this file only uses functions from our package and doesn't define functions,
we store it separately from our library of functions (our package).
We store it as a script in the `scripts` directory - see `my_first_scripts.jl`, which includes instructions for running the script.

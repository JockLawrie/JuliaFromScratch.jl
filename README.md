# Julia From Scratch

This project is aimed at getting a team started with Julia without any previous experience.

1. Install Julia. You can install without admin rights. Download the Windows 64-bit installer from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. To get a flavour of the syntax, spend 10 minutes [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/). This intro is for version 1.0.0. Although released in 2018, it is still valid code. More features have been added since, but the core features are here.

Use your discretion here.\nThe function definition has a docstring immediately above it. This provides information about the function to help users. In Julia, type using MyFirstProject if you haven't already, then type ?calculate_age_in_years.

This is achieved by encapsulating the content with triple quotes.\nWhere the function returns a string, the string is constructed from variables using string interpolation. For example, Today's date is $(today()) will return a string containing the value of today(). Use the $(put your code here) notation to achieve this.\nThe calculate_age_group function appears to be defined twice. In fact it is defined differently for different types of inputs. Notice that if the input age is a missing value (with type Missing), the result is also missing. If the input age is a real number, then the result depends on its value. Note the distinction between a variable's type and its value.\nJulia creates compiled code for each definition of the function, where each definition is known as a method of the function. When Julia encounters the function call, it identifies the types of its arguments and calls the corresponding method, which runs at native speed, which is fast. This is known as multiple dispatch, because the selected method depends on the types of all the function's arguments. Some older languages have single dispatch, and others, such as Python and R, have no dispatch and run the same code regardless of the input. No dispatch results in slower performance or errors.\nThe type Real includes integers and floating point numbers as subtypes. To see all direct subtypes of a type, use the subtypes function. For example, subtypes(Real) lists 4 subtypes. Then explore the subtypes of the subtypes, such as subtypes(Integer), and so on.\nSimilarly, the supertype function specifies the type that contains its argument as a subtype. E.g., supertype(Real).","category":"page"},{"location":"writing_functions/","page":"Write some functions","title":"Write some functions","text":"Now append the following code to the working_with_dates.jl script:","category":"page"},{"location":"writing_functions/","page":"Write some functions","title":"Write some functions","text":"sum(abs.(data.age_in_years .- ages)) == 0  # True if the calculated ages are the same as the input ages\nquantile(data.age_in_years, [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95])\n\n# Calculate each person's age group\ndata.agegroups = calculate_age_group.(data.age_in_years, 5, 85)\n\ncalculate_age_group(-3, 5, 85)\ncalculate_age_group(-0.5, 5, 85)\ncalculate_age_group(0, 5, 85)\ncalculate_age_group(12, 5, 85)\ncalculate_age_group(9999, 5, 85)","category":"page"},{"location":"writing_functions/","page":"Write some functions","title":"Write some functions","text":"Run the script and observe the results.","category":"page"},{"location":"writing_functions/#Missing-data","page":"Write some functions","title":"Missing data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"writing_functions/","page":"Write some functions","title":"Write some functions","text":"Julia has a Missing data type that has a single value, namely missing.

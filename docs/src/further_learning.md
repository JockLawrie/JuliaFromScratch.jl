# Further learning

1. To get a further taste of Julia's syntax, spend 10 minutes [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/).
   This intro is for version 1.0.0. Although released in 2018, it is still valid code.
   More features have been added since, but the core features are here.
2. [Julia By Example](https://juliabyexample.helpmanual.io/) is also a handy reference for syntax.
3. Get started with data manipulation by trying some of the exercises from the [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) documentation.
4. Search Julia's package ecosystem at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Home).
5. If you need to pull data from a database, check out the [ODBC](https://odbc.juliadatabases.org/stable/) package. There are also packages that are tailored to [specific databases](https://juliadatabases.org/).
6. To document a project, use the [Documenter](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/) package.

# Further learning

1. To get a flavour of the syntax, spend 10 minutes [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/).
   This intro is for version 1.0.0. Although released in 2018, it is still valid code.
   More features have been added since, but the core features are here.

2. Get started with data manipulation by trying some of the exercises from the [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) documentation.

3. Search Julia's package ecosystem at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Home).

4. If you need to pull data from a database, check out the [ODBC](https://odbc.juliadatabases.org/stable/) package. There are also packages that are tailored to [specific databases](https://juliadatabases.org/).

5. To document a project, use the [Documenter](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/) package.

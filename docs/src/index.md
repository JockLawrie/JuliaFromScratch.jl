# Getting Started

Get started with Julia without any previous experience.

Although some instructions are specific to Windows users, they are easily adapted to other operating systems.
The examples focus on data manipulation.

## Install Julia

You can install Julia without admin rights.
Download the Windows 64-bit installer from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
When installing, check the box for adding Julia to the PATH variable. This means you can type `julia` into PowerShell and it will start.
That is, you needn't hunt for the Julia executable on your machine.

## Install Visual Studio Code (optional)

Although Julia code can be edited in Notepad and run from the REPL, we have found it useful to work entirely from Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is available on Windows, Mac and Linux, and is often referred to as VS Code.

Moreover, the Julia extension for VS Code provides Julia-specific functionality such as syntax highlighting, which makes Julia code more visually appealing and easier to read. To install VS Code and its Julia extension, follow the instructions [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/gettingstarted/).

## Troubleshooting

Try these sources if you get stuck:

1. Help within Julia. Type the question mark then the function you are looking for. For example: `?maximum`
2. The [Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).
3. [Julia’s Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/latest) page, which is a source of news, knowledge and help.
   Search to see if your question has been asked before, or post your own.
4. A coder’s most trusty troubleshooting method, Google, and StackOverflow in particular.
